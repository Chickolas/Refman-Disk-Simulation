# Minimal Refman Disk Simulation

Repairing a corrupted C++ codebase (with destroyed headers and corrupted ".cpp" sections) so the simulation can run for ***>= 1000 steps*** without crashing, and an output can be visualised using the provided code.

## Description

The original code simulates the motion of hard disks within a 2D box with hardwall boudaries.
The goal is to reconstruct and repair the destroyed header and corrupted source files, which are needed to simulate the random motion of hard disks.

## Dependencies

- **C++17-capable compiler (e.g., g++)**
- **Python 3 (for view.py / view.ipynb)**

#Add use of the files
